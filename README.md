**Quicken doesnt track Crypto prices.  But it's pretty easy to do so.   Can't help that it isnt capable of 
tracking enough decimal precision, but it's still useful to an approximation for viewing your crypto 
assets in context with all of your investments.

#First
  In quicken, create a fake stock for each coin you want to track, but for the Symbol, prefix the 
  coin symbol with "zzz".  (this will avoid conflicting with any stocks that currently use the same
  symbol as a COIN and avoid issues if quicken supports crypt in the future)

  To do this:
1. Investing --> Tools --> Security List --> Add Security
2. At bottom of this window "If the ticker symbol  is now found...create manually...click here)
3. (I also created a new "Security Type" as well but you dont have to)
      
#Second
  Create an account on https://alphavantage.co  (NOT .com  just .co)
  On the home page click "Get your free API key"
  
  (its just a site that allows free stock price download for individuals)
